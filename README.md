# Working with Objects

### Arithmetic Operators

- As a developer, you will have a lot of tools that you can use to calculate values in JavaScript. This can be helpful in building products for stores, games, or other applications.
- Here are the operators: 
- Addition (+): Adds two or more numbers together.
- Subtraction (-): Subtracts one number from another.
- Multiplication (*): Multiplies two or more numbers.
- Division (/): Divides one number by another.
- Modulus (%): Returns the remainder after division.

- JavaScript follows the standard mathematical rules of precedence (PEMDAS), where multiplication and division are evaluated before addition and subtraction. You can use parentheses to control the order of operations if needed.

### Assignment Operator

- Assignment Operator: Remember, the equal sign, =, is the assignment operator and not a traditional equal sign. This is how you can assign and reassign values in JavaScript!
